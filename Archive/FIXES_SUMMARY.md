# ✅ Fixed Issues Summary - AMD Hackathon AI Scheduling Assistant

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully resolved critical runtime errors in the Enhanced Agentic AI Scheduling Assistant that was preventing production deployment.

## 🚨 Issues Fixed

### 1. AsyncIO Runtime Warnings
**Problem:** 
```
RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'Agent.run' was never awaited
```

**Root Cause:** 
- Mixing async Pydantic AI agent calls in synchronous context
- `Agent.run()` returns coroutine that wasn't properly awaited

**Solution:**
```python
# Before (causing warning):
result = agent.run(content, deps=deps)

# After (fixed):
try:
    # Try async execution if we're in async context
    loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future = executor.submit(asyncio.run, agent.run(content, deps=deps))
        result = future.result(timeout=30)
except:
    # Fallback to sync execution
    result = asyncio.run(agent.run(content, deps=deps))
```

### 2. Timezone Comparison Errors
**Problem:**
```
TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes
```

**Root Cause:**
- Google Calendar events returned mixed timezone formats
- Some events had timezone info (+05:30), others were naive
- Comparison operations failed between different datetime types

**Solution:**
```python
def _ensure_timezone_aware(self, dt):
    """Ensure datetime is timezone-aware"""
    if dt.tzinfo is None:
        # Convert naive datetime to timezone-aware
        return self.timezone.localize(dt)
    elif dt.tzinfo != self.timezone:
        # Convert to local timezone
        return dt.astimezone(self.timezone)
    return dt

# Applied in _busy(), _check_slot_conflicts(), _is_slot_free()
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks for async operations
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for sync/async execution paths
- ThreadPoolExecutor for proper async context management

### Timezone Consistency
- All datetime objects now consistently use IST timezone
- Automatic conversion between naive/aware datetimes
- Robust handling of mixed timezone formats from Google Calendar API

### Graceful Degradation
- System works with or without Pydantic AI availability
- Falls back to traditional pattern matching when agents fail
- Continues operation even if vLLM server is unavailable

## 📊 Test Results

### ✅ All Tests Passing
```
🎯 Overall Result: 3/3 tests passed
